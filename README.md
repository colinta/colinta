[Ashen](https://github.com/colinta/Ashen) and [Mechy](https://github.com/colinta/Mechy) are, imo, my funnest projects. A lot of the other code in here is more than a bit old. I maintain lots of Sublime Text plugins, and am usually available to support those (I'm not always eager to write features for you – if you want a feature, please consider opening a PR).

I have my github notifications silenced – I get far too many of them – so if I'm late to reply that's why. Ping me using email, "colinta @ take a lucky guess" (hint: http://colinta.com is mine)
